Welcome to the Model Monitoring in Production repository, a practical guide and toolkit for ensuring that your machine learning models remain reliable, accurate, and trustworthy after deployment.
This repository showcases end-to-end monitoring solutions with hands-on code, concepts, and real-world integrations.

🚀 Why Model Monitoring Matters

Deploying a model is only the beginning. In production, models are exposed to real-world data that can evolve — and so must your understanding of how the model behaves. Without proper monitoring, you risk:

    Model performance decay (concept drift, data drift)

    Silent failures

    Biased predictions due to population shift

    Security and fairness issues

    Wasted business opportunities

This repository helps you address all that with automated, scalable, and explainable monitoring solutions.

🔧 What’s Inside

This repo includes guides, templates, and working examples for:

📉 Drift Detection

    Data drift (input distribution change)

    Concept drift (label/prediction distribution change)

    Techniques: statistical tests, distance metrics (e.g., KL divergence, PSI)

🧪 Evaluation & Testing

    Shadow deployment

    A/B testing for model comparisons

    Canary releases

🖥️ Dashboards & Visualization

    Real-time dashboards using Grafana + Prometheus

    Integration with EvidentlyAI for visual monitoring of model metrics

    Streamlit dashboards for custom metrics

📊 Metrics Tracking

    Model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in production

    Data quality metrics (nulls, outliers, unexpected categories)

    Prediction confidence and distribution monitoring

🔁 Automation & Retraining

    Setting up alerts when performance drops

    Scheduling retraining pipelines using Airflow or custom scripts

🧰 Tools & Integrations

    EvidentlyAI, WhyLabs, Prometheus, and Grafana

    MLflow for model lifecycle tracking

    Custom REST APIs for metrics logging (using FastAPI or Flask)

    Cloud-native monitoring (AWS/GCP/Azure options)
